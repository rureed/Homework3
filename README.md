Russ Reed's Random Password Generator

This application is designed to promp the user for the following 
when clicking on the Generate Password button:
* Desired password length
* Option to use numerals
* Option to use upper case letters
* Option to use lower case letters
* Option to use special characters

After all choices are made, a random password with the desired
criteria is returned to the form.

If an invalid password length is chosen, or if the password length
is bypassed, the users gets a stern warning and the page refreshes
for another try.
